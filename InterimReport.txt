INTRODUCTION
problem, background, main ob, spec obj, expected outcomes(not in chap 4, which is Results and Discussion)
Justification and scope
2. LITERATURE REVIEW
Background and context
Current practices
How much is known and conclusion and gaps
Acknowledge Prior Projects in literature
NB: Only review, not way out
Identifactin of gaps: not necessarily mistakes or omissions, could be what you are adding
Not about describing, not even selecting solns, not a summary of literature

3.METHODOLOGY
Detailed explanation of workings.
Design considerations before choices. Standards eg.
Implemantations: 
Part circuits, part drawings, evaluation tables
White background. No title blocks.
Not too many
Include parts to 

4. RESULTS
Final detailed design with parts lists, budgets
Finer design details, codes in appendix
No figures with no explanations. Not about design drawings or 3D models, pictorials do not aid much.
No calculations.
Parameters needed. J = etcetera
Balance. Only capture details to aid analysis
Cover all info required for discussion
DISCUSSION
What does it all mean, highlight any new significant result. 
Do not restate results.
Design:
Has views and dimensions. 2D. Different perspectives. General dimension.
The 3D model comes after.
Following: Parts List: No, Quantity and 

5. Conclusion
How do my results compare with expected outcomes,
"it's different from this because of "
Where am I going from here.
State here whether you have achived

APPENDICES
BUDGET is in METHODOLOGY or RESULTS
Timeplan
Part drawings with titleblocks
Production Plans
Programming codes
Design reference tables, charts. Eg sizing bolts and nuts.
(CAD software selects bolt, nuts based on hole you have designed,)

Output is a design. Techinician shuld be

no. item Description qty Cost per Unit(Ksh) Total Cost(Kshs)


CHECKPOINTS
Plagiarism
Fraud
Inconsistencies
Generalties: are we designing sth specific or are we still coming up with design.
